Insights from reading peer students (Assignment 2)
======
### After visiting half dozen peer students' websites, I have observed that many people choose interaction method, denoted as playing, watching, reading, etc. as their primary basis of media list. 

[Yingchen Dong](https://ycdong.wixsite.com/yingchen-dong-intro/about) is oriented the interaction method and followed by the interest group. His interactions are divided into the actions of watching TVs, reading books, listening to music, playing games, etc. Whereas he further enlists the interest based on different medium providers and genres. 

Similarly, [Neha Sujith](http://people.tamu.edu/~neha2003/CSCE445.html) defines her perceptived boundaries by categorizing her interactions with media into listening to music, watching videos, playing games, messaging friends. Within these categories, she then sorts them based on the genres and purposes. 

The same trend applies to [Michael McKinsey](https://michaelmckinsey.net/portfolio/projects/csce_656.html) who arranges his list of media with social media, games, and TVs. His sublist is oriented around the purpose and genres. 

[Jung Hoon Seo](https://jseo0917.github.io/#about) agrees with the same perception and separate his favorite media into video and music. His subcatagories are related to the form of media for videos, and genres in musics.

### I also perceive some peer students identical to my ideology: categorizing frequently used media based on the purpose 

[Zihan Wang](https://sites.google.com/tamu.edu/zihancsce656/home) establishs his primary perimeters with his special intentions of networking, job hunting, amusements, etc. He further confines the sublist by assigning the specific interaction intended with each media platform. With highly focused goal and occasion, his list consolidates dense information about his daily life. 

### I also found an eccentric approach of dividing information exchanges into a layered architecture. 

Such as [Yingtao Jiang](https://taujiang.github.io/656/Assignment1)'s specialy categorization of higher-level vs. high-level media. Where he divides the medium into layers. Physical devices and compters are the higher-level media while the specific media encorporate the individual and vivid platforms providing these medias

My listing theme is oriented around device type -> medium type -> content/purpose. For devices, I only interact with either personal computing devices that carry desktop operating systems such as macbook and windows PC, or personal mobile devices such as iPad and cell phones. Then I categorize these interactions into readings, music, video, etc. as they have different websites/app I interact with. at last, I separate them further with my purpose/motivation. Where I sometimes do readings to get research literatures, whereas ocasssionally I watch videos just for fun. 

Sadly, I still do not interact with the physical world, nor do I watch TV or read any physical book
