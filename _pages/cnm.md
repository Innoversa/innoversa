CNM Statement (Assignment 1)
======
A great achievemnt is only achieved until it's been told. With the evolving age of digital media, it's important to know and grasp the channels and powers of computers and new media to demonstrate the complexity and benefits of my hardworks and contributions. And mastering the digital medium is even more relevant in research works since broadcasting findings and sharing discoveries is the fundamental purpose of researches. 

Researchers like me often miss the importance of presentation because we all love to dive deep and contest the most complex and difficult challenges unsolved. However, without the proper abilities to share the our knowledges, it becomes meaningless if they become the only people who understand and able to use them. I believe taking the class can sharpen my ways of information presentation and broadcasting, so that I can make my contributions more impactful. 

Medias I often use (Assignment 1)
======
* Internet - 100%
  * Personal Computing devices - (Laptop/PC) - 60%
    * Readings - 50%
      * Subscribed news (email and browsers) - 10%
      * Research Literatures - 30%
        * Reading new publications in my field of research - 25%
        * Peer reviewing research submissions - 5%
      * technological forums/lessons 10%
        * Stack overflow, medium, etc. - 10%

    * Readings - 5%
      * Fiction - 5%

My listing theme is oriented around device type -> medium type -> content/purpose. For devices, I only interact with either personal computing devices that carry desktop operating systems such as macbook and windows PC, or personal mobile devices such as iPad and cell phones. Then I categorize these interactions into readings, music, video, etc. as they have different websites/app I interact with. at last, I separate them further with my purpose/motivation. Where I sometimes do readings to get research literatures, whereas ocasssionally I watch videos just for fun. 

Sadly, I do not interact with the physical world, nor do I watch TV or read any physical book
