I am a passionate and dedicated researcher specializing machine learning for clinical and remote health applications, with a primary focus on enhancing remote-sensing data quality, accurately monitoring cardiovascular diseases remotely, and tackling data heterogenity in clinical settings.
I am driven by the potential of leveraging cutting-edge technology to make a positive impact on patient outcomes and revolutionize the way healthcare is delivered.

I'm a proud member of [STMI lab](https://stmilab.github.io/team/), advised by Dr. Bobak Mortazavi.
