<h2>Information about me</h2>
<h3>Who am I</h3>
<p>I'm a <abbr>ML4H</abbr> (<em>Machine Learning</em> for healthcare) researcher. I dedicate on tackling real world clinical challenges such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertensions, and cardiac rehabitations. Harnessing the power of continous puslatile vitals from wearable sensors, I bring machine learning solutions precise to stakeholders, reproducible to colleagues, and robust across different cohorts.</p>
<h3>What do I Digest to Live</h3>
<br>
<p>My favorite food should be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumpling">dumplings</a>.</p>

<h2>Information about my interest in accessibility</h2>
<p>A great achievemnt is only achieved until it is told. Mastering the <em>accessibility computing skill</em> is very relevant in research works since broadcasting findings and sharing discoveries is the fundamental purpose of researches.</p>

<p>Researchers like me often miss the importance of presentation because we all love to dive deep and contest the most complex and difficult challenges unsolved. However, without the proper abilities to share the our knowledges, it becomes meaningless if they become the only people who understand and able to use them. I believe taking the class can sharpen my ways of information presentation and broadcasting, so that I can make my contributions more impactful.</p>
