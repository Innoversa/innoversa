## About Me

I'm currently a pursuing PhD in Computer Science at Texas A&M University, a member of STMI lab, advised by Dr. Bobak Mortazavi.

I am a passionate and dedicated researcher specializing machine learning for clinical and remote health applications, with a primary focus on enhancing remote-sensing data quality, accurately monitoring cardiovascular diseases remotely, and tackling data heterogenity in clinical settings. I am driven by the potential of leveraging cutting-edge technology to make a positive impact on patient outcomes and revolutionize the way healthcare is delivered.

Specifically, I am deeply interested in time-series analysis and its application to cardiovascular data. By harnessing the power of machine learning algorithms, I aim to extract meaningful insights from complex pulsatile physiological signals, such as Photoplethysmography (PPG), bio impedance, and electrocardiograms (ECGs) to accurately monitor hemodynamic parameters and detect cardiovascular diseases. I am also interested in developing both data-driven and method(knowledge)-driven novel signal processing techniques to enhance the quality of remote-sensing data, to improve prediction of any downstream ML-infused remote health monitoring.
